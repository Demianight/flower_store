Few issues which I would like to describe:

- Models structure pretty much depends on idea of project, for example if there have to be any type of flower lists, obviously models_extra come in handy, only for trades my choice is original models.

- Hidden offers should be handle in viewsets/API views etc., just Offer.objects.filter(hidden=False), so it's not work of models.

- Handling of proper permissions shouldn't be in models, so check it in some permissions file.

- What about fifth item, is user.trades enough? Get it in API and format in frontend

Okay, quick overview:

1. Roles added
2. Required models created
3. Field for managing it added, but mostly work of API
4. Required models created
5. user.trades, voila! format it in frontend then
6. To get list of type [seller, [all, his, sales], total_profit], just call User.make_list() (classmethod)
